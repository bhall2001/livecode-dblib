## History
I've wanted to build this library since forever. After using similar libraries with PHP and Ruby, I decided that we really needed some 
easy library for database access but I always postponed creating one.

After Ralf released RevIgniter (http://www.revigniter.com) I became spoiled by his database implementation. It was perfect but it worked
only on the server side. Now with my mobile developments, I needed something that worked locally with SQLite. So I decided to build
this library.
